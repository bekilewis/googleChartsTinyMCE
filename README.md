===================

Google Charts plugin for TinyMCE

See: https://developers.google.com/chart/<br />
See: http://www.tinymce.com/<br/>

This project is working but is still in development. The code is very messy still, I will clean it up and update it soon. If you have any queries about implementation, or would like to help make this plugin work better please send me a message. 

I am not an expert on tinyMCE, and this project has been bodged together from various projects. Please feel free to update and improve any of my code, whether it is the tinyMCE part of the plugin, the Google Charts part, or the Hand on Table code.

This plugin currently uses a database to store the JSON strings for each graph (I will add details of the database structure soon). If you would like to further develop this plugin so that it doesn't require the use of the database I would be more than happy to add in your code!
